# Ninja-Pacman-Game
// The goal I had for creating this code was to create a base functioning of a pacman game with custom peices. 
// I started with making a array to for the pacman world and causing constricts that the character can move through. 
// I also added custum characters to represent pac-man and the pearls. 
// Lastly I gave moveablility to the ninja pac-man character. 
// (Goal for this future code: Add enemies to chase the ninja, Add point counter for collected custom pearls, add endgame function, and lastly add random world generation.)
